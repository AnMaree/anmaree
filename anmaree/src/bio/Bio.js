                  <p>My love for design and technology was obvious at an early age. I was born into a family of entrepreneurs who taught me that design was a differentiating factor for any business. When I wasn't climbing palm trees as a kid in my hometown of St.Thomas, I was making business cards for my part-time snow cone business, creating pitch presentations for my mother's wedding company, and learning HTML and CSS through my embarrassing obsession with MySpace.</p>
                  <p>I continued to hone my design skills at the University of Michigan's School of Art & Design. There I focused on UX/UI design and took independent studies in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After college, I fell in love with the hustle and grit of Detroit. I worked with over 25 Detroit startups on product design and development, helping to build a technology ecosystem in a town that desperately needed tech innovation.</p>
                  <p>After my time in Detroit I joined SeedInvest, a leading Equity Crowdfunding platform based in New York City. Being in the financial capital of the world and helping startups raise money honored my passion for supporting small business. When Iâ€™m not jumping on the L to Manhattan, you can find me at Black Star Coffee researching UX trends or deploying new features to my Github account.</p>
